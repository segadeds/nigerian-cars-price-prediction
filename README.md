In the automotive sector, pricing analytics play an essential role for both companies and individuals to assess the market price of a vehicle before putting it on sale or buying it. My goal with this Data Science Project was to estimate the price of used Nigerian cars by taking into account a set of features, based on historical data.
The art of pricing is not an easy task and is sometimes only done by experts in the field, but with the study of historical data, it is possible to find patterns that lead to results just as good. Acquiring this knowledge can provide you with a comparative advantage before putting a vehicle on sale or buying it on the market. 
With this project, I built a model that can predict the price of used cars, given a set of features. This information can have an enormous value for both companies and individuals when trying to understand how to estimate the value of their vehicles.
